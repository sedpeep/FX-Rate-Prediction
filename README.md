# FX-Rate-Prediction
This project aims to predict future currency exchange rates using machine learning models, specifically an LSTM neural network and a Random Forest regressor. The dataset contains historical exchange rates and COVID-19 policy data from the OxCGRT dataset. The models are trained to forecast upcoming rates based on past trends and policy changes.
